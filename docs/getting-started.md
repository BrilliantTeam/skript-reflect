# Getting Started

## Installation

1. Download the latest `skript-reflect.jar` from GitHub
2. Move `skript-reflect.jar` to your `plugins/` folder
3. If you have third-party libraries you would like to use \(that are not Bukkit plugins\), [follow the steps outlined here.](advanced/loading-external-libraries.md)

Tip: Enable effect commands in Skript's config! Effect commands make it extremely easy to prototype and test Skript code, which can be especially useful when working with skript-reflect.
