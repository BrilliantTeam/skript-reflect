# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why don't you keep documentation on another site?

Though many Skript-specific documentation sites have popped up and grown in popularity, these sites typically have two issues that make them an unattractive option for skript-reflect.

* Documentation is usually stored solely by the site. If the site ever breaks or shuts down, this means the documentation may be lost as well.
* These sites lack the flexibility of other documentation solutions. Generally, these sites focus on documenting each feature individually. While this might be adequate for many simpler Skript addons, skript-reflect's complexity necessitates the use of manually organized documentation.

That being said, third-party sites may display the contents of skript-reflect's documentation, but they would be responsible for keeping the documentation up-to-date. For the convenience of other scripters, these sites should prominently display [a link to the documentation](https://tpgamesnl.gitbook.io/) on each page. Please avoid documenting features individually or using an automated tool to extract syntax patterns from skript-reflect. Most of skript-reflect's core features are best explained using hand-written documentation.
